    Thanks for opening this issue!
    I have applied any labels matching special text in your title and description.

    Please review the labels and make any necessary changes.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  ":fix: fix":
    include:
      - '\bfix\b'
  ":star2: refactor":
    include:
      - '\brefactor\b'
  ":blue_book: documentation":
    include:
      - '\bdocs\b'
  ":broom: chore":
    include:
      - '\bchore\b'
  ":framed_picture: feat":
    include:
      - '\bfeat\b'
  ":test_tube: test":
    include:
